# Anti-Cancer-Drug-Activity-Prediction

This competition is a bioassay task for anticancer activity prediction, where each chemical compound is represented as a graph, with atoms representing nodes and bonds as edges. 
A chemical compound is positive against non-small cell lung cancer, or negative otherwise.

The notebook consists of:

1) General Questions & their answers to enhance understanding the problem domain.
2) Problem Questions & their answers to enhance understanding the problem solutions.
3) Import important libraries.
4) Read SDF format data (structured-data format).
   - You will find the data link in ("Link of competition on Kaggle") file attached above.
5) Visualizing/Inspecting a Sample.
6) Preprocessing.
   
7) Trial 1:5 (with unbalanced data)
   - Model Structure
   - Compile The Model
   - Train The Model
   - Predictoin And Submission

8) Solve Unbalanced Data.

9) Trial 6:10 (with balanced data)
   - Model Structure
   - Compile The Model
   - Train The Model
   - Predictoin And Submission.

Note: For Each trial, I tried different features, different hyperparameters/configurations of the model and different models. Also For each one, I documented the reason why I want to make the certain change and the expected outcome, before running the code. Recorded the observed performance and my thought on it.
